  description: 'This mod creates Web API to load mission mods and start the mission.

    You can access to https://ktane.timwi.de/More/DeMiLMissionViewer/index.html to
    see the missions you have installed, see their details, and start the mission.

    Once you press "Save and disable all mods", the mission mods will be disabled
    in game, but you can still view them through the web page.


    This mod is still under development. If you found any bugs, please report to t-chen#5876
    in discord.
